# About me ðŸ‘‹

Hej! I am Fabian, a visual product designer and frontend developer from the beautiful city of Nuremberg, Germany. Nuremberg is known for its rich cultural heritage, with stunning architecture and museums that reflect the city's rich history. From its medieval castle to its well-preserved town walls, Nuremberg is a truly unique place that has shaped me as a person and a designer.

I have been passionate about web design since I was 14 years old and started creating my first websites. Over the years, I have honed my skills, becoming both a proficient designer and coder. Web design is not just a job for me, it's a true passion that I put my heart and soul into every day.

Before I became a freelancer, I had the privilege of working as a visual designer for immowelt.de, one of Germany's largest real estate brands. This experience taught me the importance of effective communication, teamwork, and attention to detail, skills that I still use in my work today.

My ultimate goal has always been to help businesses and individuals create unique web experiences that reflect their values and goals. I believe that a website or app should be more than just a digital representation of a brand. It should be a reflection of the people and values behind it, and I am passionate about helping businesses bring their visions to life.

In 2022, my dream finally came true and I started my own freelance web design business. I am now eager to use my skills and experience to help customers like you create websites and apps that not only look great, but also deliver results. So if you're looking for a web designer who is passionate, talented, and dedicated, look no further. I am here to help.
